Are sulfonylureas associated with increased mortality in diabetics treated with thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction?,"Sulfonylureas use prior to admission is not associated with adverse outcomes in diabetics treated with thrombolytics for myocardial infarction. Since direct angioplasty may increase mortality in patients taking these drugs, a randomized trial is needed to specifically compare different strategies of acute reperfusion in diabetics.Abbreviated abstract. Increased mortality has been reported in diabetics using sulfonylureas when treated for myocardial infarction by direct angioplasty. No study has specifically addressed the effect of these drugs on outcomes in the setting of thrombolysis. In a retrospective analysis of 245 diabetics treated with thrombolysis in a randomized comparison of argatroban vs. heparin, outcomes were compared in relation to anti-diabetic therapy prior to admission. Sulfonylurea use did not adversely affect prognosis, which was worst among diabetics previously treated with insulin.

Does phosducin induce a structural change in transducin beta gamma?,"beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins can exist in two distinct conformations. In the R (relaxed) state, corresponding to the structure of the free beta gamma or the structure of beta gamma in the alpha beta gamma heterotrimer, the hydrophobic farnesyl moiety of the gamma subunit is exposed, thereby mediating membrane association. In the T (tense) state, as observed in the phosducin-Gt beta gamma structure, the farnesyl moiety of the gamma subunit is effectively buried in the cavity formed between blades 6 and 7 of the beta subunit. Binding of phosducin to Gt beta gamma induces the formation of this cavity, resulting in a switch from the R to the T conformation. This sequesters beta gamma from the membrane to the cytosol and turns off the signal-transduction cascade. Regulation of this membrane association/dissociation switch of Gt beta gamma by phosducin may be a general mechanism for attenuation of G protein coupled signal transduction cascades.",0,"Binding of phosducin to Gt beta gamma induces the formation of this cavity, resulting in a switch from the R to the T conformation.

Does the Epigenome of Schistosoma mansoni provide Insight about How Cercariae Poise Transcription until Infection?,"We describe here a broad view on the epigenome of a metazoan parasite. Most notably, we find bivalent histone H3 methylation in cercariae.

Does a minimal model of signaling network elucidate cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptosis?,"We show that the proposed minimal signaling network displays two distinct types of response as the strength of the stimulus is decreased. The signaling network has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a strong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the strength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins dominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with characteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability. Interestingly, this proposed stochastic signaling network can capture some of the essential signaling behaviors of a complex apoptotic cell death signaling network that has been studied through experiments and large-scale computer simulations. Thus we claim that the proposed signaling network is an appropriate minimal model of apoptosis signaling. Elucidating the fundamental design principles of complex cellular signaling pathways such as apoptosis signaling remains a challenging task. We demonstrate how our proposed minimal model can help elucidate the effect of a specific apoptotic inhibitor Bcl-2 on apoptotic signaling in a cell-type independent manner.
